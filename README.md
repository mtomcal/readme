# Michael.readme

## Quick start guide

* An engineer who works on front end products, enterprise tooling and design systems (current job)
* I live in the Phoenix metro area and grew up in Eugene, Oregon area.
* I like to creatively express myself as a Celtgrass fiddler, landscape photographer, and software engineer chasing after simple solutions
* I enjoy spending time getting to know my fellow humans
* Mostly auditory learner (audiobooks > print)
* Myers-Brigg ENFP but I definitely don't fit that mold in many cases.

## My job-to-be-done and how I know Iâ€™m successful

As a design system engineer:

* Translate accessibility into simple composable React Components within the design language
* Developers intuitively go from documentation to implementation
* Developers walk away from a support thread feeling empowered
* Designing self-service tools that enable product teams to gain insights and move quickly

## What I value

* A safe space for collaborative creative problem solving
* Empathy for users and fellow colleagues
* Balancing software endeavors with music, photography and people
* Shipping impact and results
* Self-sufficient empowered teams
* Growth mindset to always refine people-skills and technical ideas

## Who I am

I am an enthusiastic person who enjoys spending time with people. In the early days, I valued playing classical violin and building star trek fan websites. I always was thrilled when someone enjoyed a song I played or enjoyed the websites I created. Funny enough my hobby became my career! Now I get to create experiences and components that reach many more people (millions in fact) than my star trek websites ever did. After starting my career, I jumped into a landscape photography hobby to explore visual art more in the landscapes of Arizona and Oregon. I see all my creative social avenues, software, music, and photography holistically. This means they all work together to help me grow in creativity and intuition.

### Features / strengths

* **Im a big picture thinker** - I am always asking myself how a deliverable fits into the greater strategy and actively look for value inside that strategy
* **I enjoy sharing crazy ideas that just might work** - I live for idea exchanges. While in many cases they do not generate lasting value, I live for that one magical idea that may be a game-changer.
* **I am passionate about simple documentation** - I feel warm and fuzzy when developers take documentation I authored and go to implementation with little to no assistance
* **I enjoy bringing people together to solve problems** - Solving through problems is best shared with the team. I enjoy helping to sift through pros and cons with others.

### In development / growth areas

* **Remote Communication** - I have radar for body language that just does not work over remote as well. I hope to keep refining my remote communication skills and raise my hand more when I need to speak over Zoom
* **Keep asking questions and deliver feedback** - I don't ask enough questions when someone is passionate about something as I would rather avoid confrontation. I also want to develop delivering kind but honest feedback per Radical Candor.

### Known bugs / things I do that may annoy you

* **I think out-loud and talk alot** - Depending on the person I may talk too much and think out loud quite a bit. Remote communication mitigates much of this and I do actively try to limit what I say and listen more.

### Gaining trust

* **Be genuine** - Be kindly authentic with your interactions
* **Give me space** - I do not work well with all forms of micro-management. Give me a big picture and Ill collaborate and develop my way to victory.
* **Teach a person to fish for a lifetime** - Help me understand how to tackle a problem. This way I am empowered to solve the problem and can share the knowledge with others

## Logistics / communication

* I prefer scheduling video calls into a couple predictable days of the week if possible. I like to prevent context-switching between scattered meetings and deep think software development time.
* Slack back-and-forths work well for light topics but lets hit video for deep topics and ideas

## Submit a bug / how I give and receive feedback

* Please schedule a face-to-face video call with me and provide kind, timely, actionable feedback so I may improve
* I will ask how an individual wishes to receive feedback and deliver kind honest feedback accordingly
